# javaScript-test-practice
This project was created to practise test driven development using javascript i worked with npm and jest. 
For this project, I will be creating 5 JavaScript programs 
(capitalise.js, reverseString.js, calculator.js, analyseArray.js, caesarCipher.js) 
and then creating a testing suite to test these programs.
